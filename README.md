# Pogtopia
This is the official Source Code for the Server Pogtopia, coming with features unlike other Private Servers. This will be maintained properly by me, Contributors can help if you guys want.

## Licensing
You may read what the details about the license [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0/). But the main focus is that, when you will use this server code, you must make it **public**. With or without modifications, and do not change the license to anything other than the **GNU General Public License v2.0**. Have a great day.

## Installation
